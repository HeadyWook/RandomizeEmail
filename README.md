# throw_away_email_randomizer

This program creates random usernames and passwords for throw away email addresses. It generates two
random sets of strings. The length of which is determined by the user. The character set includes lower (i.e.,
abc...xyz) and uppercase (i.e., ABC...XYZ) letters and numbers (i.e., 0-9). The purpose of this program is to
automate online character randomizers on a local machine.
For example, Bob wants to create a throw away email address to sign up for some service. He can access
https://mail.cock.li through Tor, run this program on his local machine, generate a random username and password,
and copy and paste each string into the respective fields. Bob does not have to spend the mental effort to make up a
username and password. He can also avoid using variants of existing emails. He skip the online character randomizer.
Bob can then do what he likes with the string sets. He may delete them or save them in a .txt file for later,
like so:

randomThrowAwayEmail.txt
